# CodSoft-Internship

Internship Projects
This repository contains three data science projects that I completed during my internship. Each project involves a different machine learning task and showcases my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## 2. Task2 Iris Flower Classification

Objective:
Classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Key Features:
Data exploration and visualization
Model building using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Model evaluation using confusion matrix, F1-score, and cross-validation

Dataset:
